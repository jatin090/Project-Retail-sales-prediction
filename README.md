# Project-Retail-sales-prediction
I dealt with the past data of Europe Drug stores in this project and the dataset name was "Rossmann Store"

## After Exploratory data Analysis, I used different Regression algorithms for training the model

### Following are some conlusions 

There were 4 different type of stores among which 54% stores were of type – a which was maximum, and the least was type – b

There were 1115 different stores among which 38% stores were running promo and 62% are not

we can say maximum sales by store type “b”, but also the number of store with type “b” is minimum so we should consider type “a”

 From 212 stores, store number - 158, 277, 370, 612, 637, 808, 960 had run the promo for maximum number of months i.e. 71 months

 Store number 815 had a competition from year 1900, so more than 100 years

 We made these PromoOpen negative values to zeros, because they have not started the promos at that time

 Decision tree was the best for this dataset problem
